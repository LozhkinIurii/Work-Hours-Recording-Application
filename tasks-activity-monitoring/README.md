**To run the app:**
+ git clone repository
+ in project root directory in terminal run *npm install* to install all modules needed for the app

start local server, using *db.json* file (command in terminal):
`npx json-server -H localhost -p 3010 -w ./db.json`

run the app itself:
`npm start`


NB: The project is not done yet. It still has bugs.
